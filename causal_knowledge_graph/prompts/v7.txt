You are an expert in identifying causal relationships between sequential events based on their descriptions and dates.

This dataset is from the GDELT event database, which records global events with timestamps and actor information.

Here is a list of sequential events:
{events_text}

Task: Identify plausible causal relationships BETWEEN these events. Find pairs where an earlier event (Cause) logically led to a later event (Effect).
        
Requirements:
1. Identify the 'cause_idx' and 'effect_idx' from the list above.
2. Strict Temporal Order: The Cause must happen BEFORE the Effect. Future events cannot be the cause of past events. (Check the 'Date' order).
3. Counterfactual Check: Verify logical dependency by asking: 'If the Cause had not occurred, would the Effect still have happened?' If the answer is 'Yes', discard it.
4. Causal Mechanism: Ensure there is a direct functional link where the Cause actively leads to the Effect (e.g., triggers, causes, requires).
5. Provide a brief 'reason' with exact Actors names (e.g. PRK) in Cause and Effect. (Less than 15 words)
6. Ignore unrelated events. If no relationships are found, return [].

Output Format (JSON list):
[
  {\"cause_idx\": 1, \"effect_idx\": 3, \"reason\": \"PRK's agreement to enhance economic cooperation probably triggered USA's subsequent statement.\"},
  {\"cause_idx\": 5, \"effect_idx\": 6, \"reason\": \"...\"}
